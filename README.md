# Automatizating-adding-in-Bulk

Brief explanation:

The programm will ask you for the parameter you'll use. Tf2Autobot supports five types of them.

You just need to select the parameter by typing the number or writing the name. Then, you just need to type the item's parameter you selected.

The output will be:

!addbulk "parameter" = "item
"parameter" = "item
"parameter" = "item
"parameter" = "item
"parameter" = "item
.
.
.

Remember that !addbulk command only works for more than 1  item.
